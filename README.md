# DeeeepLinkk-SA

A simple application that allows triggering deeplinks. Wrote this out of being frustrated by shitty options available at ps. You can get the APK via latest CI build from [application-ci](https://github.com/s-ayush2903/DeeeepLinkk-SA/actions/workflows/ci.yml) action or [apk](https://github.com/s-ayush2903/DeeeepLinkk-SA/tree/apk) branch, the build here gets automatically updated as per latest commits in default branch.
